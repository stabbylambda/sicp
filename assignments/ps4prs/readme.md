# Prisoner's dilemma

### Relevant sections in text: 1.3, 2.2.1

This assignment presents a simple game-playing program, in which strategies are represented as higher-order procedures. [The Game of Twenty-One](../ps2tw1/readme.html) assignment takes a similar approach. The prisoner's dilemma game also uses some simple list-manipulation commands. There is an opportunity here to run prisoner's dilemma tournament for the class.

We are grateful to Franklyn Turbak, Mike Eisenberg, and Mitch Resnick for developing this assignment.
