# Picture language

### Relevant section in text: 2.2.4

This is the original material on the square-limit language, which was revised to form section 2.2.4 of the book. For explanations of how the language works, you should use the book rather than the assignment text given here. We have not included a postscript file here, because the explanation (and the figures) in the book are better.

The code below includes an implementation of primitive painters for line-drawings and two-dimensional images. This code is specific to MIT Scheme. It includes a constructor that creates primitive painters from `pgm` files.
